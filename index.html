She has been playing trumpet for 11 years and has performed with groups such as the All-Eastern Orchestra and McGill Wind Orchestra.

Through these internships, she has administered clinical visits and has acquired coding experience with GitHub and RStudio. In addition, she also was a Senior Apprentice at the Eli Whitney Museum and Workshop for seven years.  She designed, prototyped, and produced wood-working projects for summer camps. She also designed and led the “Mad Science” camp for kids ages 12 and up. She currently studies at the Schulich School of Music at McGill University. Current projects include working on the production team as Prop Master for the McGill Classic’s Play, Antigone. This role includes sourcing, building, and organizing a variety of props for the show.  </p>
